# Health-Informatics-portfolio
This repository contains academic projects completed as part of a Health Informatics course. 
The portfolio demonstrates foundational knowledge of health informatics concepts, healthcare 
information systems, decision support, usability, and human–technology interaction in clinical 
and healthcare environments.

Each folder represents an individual assignment completed in a simulated healthcare role and 
addresses real-world challenges in health informatics through analysis, communication, and 
design-based solutions.
